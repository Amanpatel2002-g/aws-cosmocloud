# Student Management System Documentation

This document provides an overview and instructions for setting up the Student Management System project locally.

## Overview

The Student Management System is a FastAPI-based application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. It uses MongoDB as the database to store student information.

### Project Structure

```

- `app`: Contains the main application logic.
- `api`: Contains API routers for handling HTTP requests.
- `config`: Contains configuration files, including settings and constants.
- `db`: Contains files related to database operations.
- `models.py`: Contains data models.
- `services.py`: Contains business logic services.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions.
- `main.py`: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
- `.env`: Environment variables configuration file.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing required Python dependencies.

## Local Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd student-management-system
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 6: Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the environment variables:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
MONGODB_DB_NAME=student_db
```

Replace the MongoDB URI and database name with your local MongoDB configuration.

### Step 7: Run the Application

Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The application will start running on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Usage

You can now access the API endpoints using an API client like Postman or cURL. Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints and usage.
